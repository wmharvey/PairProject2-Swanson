  <h2 class="quote">"History began on July 4, 1776. Everything that happened before that was a mistake."</h2>

  <p>A man for America. He was born in a small town to Tamara Swanson (referred to as Tammy Zero by Ron) and an unknown father. He grew up on a farm in a small town and has enjoyed woodworking from an early age. He built his first chair at age five. Ron is opposed to child labor laws, stating he got his first job at a sheet metal factory at age nine and, in two weeks, was running the floor. Ron says that at age eleven, he was offered a higher paying job at the tannery and attempted to do both jobs while going to middle school before realizing it would be better to only work at the sheet metal factory. Ron claims that, at age 12, he went to prom and was working at a quarry.</p>

  <h2 class="quote">"It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teet until they have sore, chapped nipples"</h2>

  <p>Ron is a man for the people, man for change, a man for breakfast. He promises the complete dissolution of the current corrupt, and weak-willed government that is stealing our freedoms. Ron promises to reinstate the values of his own 'Pyramid of Greatness'. Categories include Capitalism: God's way of determining who is smart and who is poor. Crying: acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon. Rage. Poise. Property rights. Fish: for sport only, not for meat. Fish meat is practically a vegetable.</p>

  <h2 class="quote">"I have so many ideas. Some are simple like take down traffic lights and eliminate the post office. The bigger ones will be tougher, like 'bring this crumbling to the ground.'"</h2>

  <p>Ron Swanson has been Director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department for six years. He believes in the elimination of government waste and has always brought the department in under budget. Imagine the waste he could get rid of on a national level.</p>

  <h2 class="quote">"There is only one bad word: Taxes."</h2>

  <p>He enjoys woodworking, breakfast meats, and the works of Ayn Rand. He is also an avid hunter and fisherman, and may or may not in some way be connected to the famous jazz saxophonist known as "Duke Silver".</p>

  <h2 class="quote">"I was born ready. I'm Ron F****** Swanson"</h2>
